# 🎀 Cute Simple Calculator

A pastel-themed calculator built with Python and Tkinter.
This is my first project, a simple calculator app with a soft, playful design to brighten your desktop!

## ✨ Features

* Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, parentheses, and decimals.
* Hover effects for all buttons for a more interactive feel.
* Custom color palette with light pastel pinks and greens.
* Designed with **Comic Sans MS** to keep it cute and fun.
* Error handling for invalid calculations.

## 🐣 About This Project

This is a **beginner project** I created to practice Python programming and learn how to use Tkinter for building desktop apps.
It helped me understand event handling, UI layout, functions, and styling with code.

## 🙇‍♀️ Author
This project was inspired by an tutorial from "NeuralNine"  but I modified parts of the code, added custom design elements, and used it as practice to build my own version as a beginner.
